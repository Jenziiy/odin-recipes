        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
                <li> Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.</li>
                <li>Add the egg and half the milk to the well. Mix until the ingredients are combined. </li>
                <li>Slowly add the remaining milk.The texture should be like a thin pancake or crepe batter.</li>
                <li>Heat a large (12") non-stick skillet over medium. Melt a teaspoon of butter and swirl to coat the pan.</li>
                <li>Pour 1/2 cup of the batter into the pan and swirl to create a large thin pancake that covers the bottom of the pan.</li>
                <li>Place several slices of the speck or bacon over the top of the pancake. Cook until the top of the pancake is set.</li>
                <li>Flip the pancake over and cook until that side is browned. Flip back over so the speck is on top.</li>
                <li>Add a few slices of cheese, cover and allow the cheese to melt.</li>
                <li>Serve hot or hold in a warm oven while you make the remaining pancakes</li>
